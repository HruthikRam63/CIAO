CIAO is constantly evolving. Some future improvements we’re planning include:

*   **Mood Detection Integration**: In the future, we aim to incorporate facial recognition and mood detection to provide more personalized and accurate content. This would take your facial expressions into account to suggest mood-boosting content. A similar feature has been implemented in our previous project, [MoodFlix](https://github.com/HruthikRam63/MoodFlix).
*   **Better User Interaction**: Incorporating voice-based feedback and response systems.
*   **Expanding Content Types**: Adding more diverse categories such as music, news, and motivational podcasts.
